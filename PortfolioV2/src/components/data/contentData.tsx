            I have always had an eye for nice aesthetic. From young, I would
            spend hours drawing and sketching on papers and desks. I have
            probably costed my parents hundreds in poorly half-drawn, scribbled
            papers.

            In secondary school, I met a friend who introduced me to graphic
            design. As a 9th grader with no income and a new addiction to the
            online world of video games, I was ecstatic to hear that he created
            digital graphics for rappers and artists online for real money. Real
            money that could be irresponsibally spent on digital skins.

            That friend would eventually invite me to a{" "}
            <span className="p-bold">online design collective</span> he created
            in which I partially helped managed as a Creative Director. In a
            way, we were a mini, student-run, design agency.

            Since this was a temporary side hustle/hobby during school, I
            managed to only peak at just above 300 followers. However, my posts
            were often fortunately reposted on large cover art Instagram
            accounts such as @AlbumArtArchive (before their rebranding), and
            gained acknowledgement by teams such as @StudioInnate.

            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type

            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,

            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            To me, what's worth more than the experience and prestige you gain
            from holding executive positions in clubs are the connections you
            make. Thus, I often partake in positions at clubs unrelated to my
            area of study, as I value most their varying perspectives.
